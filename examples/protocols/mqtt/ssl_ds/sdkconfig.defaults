# Setting partition table offset to 0xC000 would make the address of
# `esp_secure_cert` partition as 0xD000 (comes next in the sequence).
# Modules that are programmed with  Espressif Secure Pre Provisioining service
# uses this offset for `esp_secure_cert` and hence this change aligns this example
# to work on those modules.
